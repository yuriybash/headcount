# Venmo Oauth
Using the Venmo authentication requires a couple different steps (see https://developer.venmo.com/docs/oauth). First, anyone with a regular Venmo account needs to access his/her development tab, where the required client ID and client secret keys can be found. These must be used in routes/index.js (line ~250) to redirect the user to the correct Venmo endpoint to allow the user to authorize a Venmo account with Headcount. Additionally, the base url for the application (currently http:/www.theheadcount.com/) must be entered in the Venmo development panel to allow for successful redirects.
